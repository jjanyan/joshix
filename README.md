*This is very much a work in progress*

Set Up:
------------------
You must modify your **.bashrc** file to include the items in **example_bashrc.sh**

Other than that, poke around in the folders and find commands you might find useful.

  - cd1 - *move up **one** directory and 'ls'*
  - cd2 - *move up **two** directory and 'ls'*
  - cd3-5 - *same as above, n-times*
  - j **somefolder** [enter] - *regex on your cd history for **somefolder** and go there.* 
  - jp - ***mac only.** create cd command to the current directory and copy to clipboard. useful for opening another tab and pasting the command to go directly to folder you were in*

TODO:
-----------

  - Improve the README
  - Give more details on all of the commands and settings
